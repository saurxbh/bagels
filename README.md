Repo for Bagels, a deductive logic game

You must guess a three-digit number in 10 tries.
The game offers three hints in response to your guess:
1) 'Pico' when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place.
2) 'Fermi' when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place.
3) 'Bagels' if your guess has no correct digits.
